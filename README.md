# Reinforcement Learning Summer School 2017

To compile the `tile-coding` library:
1. `cd tile-coding`
2. `make`
3. `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:pathto/tile-coding`


## 300+ Notebooks from McGill COMP-767, Intro to RL

A collections of notebooks written by the students of
McGill COMP-767, Intro to RL. We had a "bring your own assignment" model
in which the students would create their own "assignment" related to the
course material. The assignments would generally take the form of a Jupyter notebook
exploring some questions empirically and/or theoretically.
